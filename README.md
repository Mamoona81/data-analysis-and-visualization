# Earthquake Data Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an earthquake dataset obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal of this project is to gain insights into the patterns and characteristics of earthquakes, which can be useful for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the [Earthquake Database]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database]) from Kaggle. It contains information on earthquakes that have occurred around the world since 1995-2023, including details such as location, magnitude, depth, and date/time.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. `earthquake_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the code and analysis for the earthquake dataset.
2. `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Installation
To run the analysis, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of exploratory data analysis techniques to gain a better understanding of earthquake patterns and characteristics. The insights gained can be useful for improving disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.
